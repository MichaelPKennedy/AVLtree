# AVLtree
tree.java is an avl tree coded from scratch with insert, rotate, and height methods. The tree is made up of nodes and stays balanced by rotating appropriately when the height difference of any subtree becomes greater than 1. AVLtree.java demonstrates the tree by inserting a million nodes with randomly generated numbers as the key values. It then prints the height of the AVL tree.
